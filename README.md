<h1>This is my portfolio project for my Operating Systems 1 class.</h1>
<p>Everything found below is directly taken from the canvas page of this assignment.  I would describe this class as the indepth analysis of the tools at your disposole.  There are definitly times where I struggled with programming but for the majroity of this class therre was no difficulty with logic or concept souly just learning about your tools and how to use them.  For the outcomes of this class I was taught the basics of operating systems and how to make access of your tools but the biggest thing I learned was a soft skill; I was taught the value of getting started early and time managment.  This was a hard class and refered to as a weed-out class but I was able to get through because I was dilligent about my time management and completed all my projcts a week in before they were due.</p>

<h2>Description of files:</h2>
<ul>
  <strong>main.c:</strong> This is the code that creates the user interface</br>
  <strong>code.c:</strong> This code is where all the leg work done</br>
  <strong>smallsh:</strong> This is the executable file for the project</br>
  <strong>p3testscript:</strong> This is the test file my graders used
</ul>

<h2>Criteria:</h2>
In this assignment you will write smallsh your own shell in C. smallsh will implement a subset of features of well-known shells, such as bash. Your program will
<ol>
  <li>Provide a prompt for running commands</li>
  <li>Handle blank lines and comments, which are lines beginning with the # character</li>
  <li>Provide expansion for the variable $$</li>
  <li>Execute 3 commands exit, cd, and status via code built into the shell</li>
  <li>Execute other commands by creating new processes using a function from the exec family of functions</li>
  <li>Support input and output redirection</li>
  <li>Support running commands in foreground and background processes</li>
  <li>Implement custom handlers for 2 signals, SIGINT and SIGTSTP</li>
</ol>



<h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>After successful completion of this assignment, you should be able to do the following</li>
<li>Describe the Unix process API (Module 4, MLO 2)</li>
<li>Write programs using the Unix process API (Module 4, MLO 3)</li>
<li>Explain the concept of signals and their uses (Module 5, MLO 2)</li>
<li>Write programs using the Unix API for signal handling (Module 5, MLO 3)</li>
<li>Explain I/O redirection and write programs that can employ I/O redirection (Module 5, MLO 4)</li>
</ul>
