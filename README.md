<h1>This is my portfolio project for my Operating Systems 1 class.</h1>
<p>Everything found below is directly taken from the canvas page of this assignment.  </p>

<h2>Description of files:</h2>
<ul>
  <strong>main.c:</strong> This is the code that creates the user interface</br>
  <strong>code.c:</strong> This code is where all the leg work done</br>
  <strong>smallsh:</strong> This is the executable file for the project</br>
  <strong>p3testscript:</strong> This is the test file my graders used
</ul>

<h2>Criteria:</h2>
In this assignment you will write smallsh your own shell in C. smallsh will implement a subset of features of well-known shells, such as bash. Your program will
