<h1>This is my portfolio project for my Operating Systems 1 class.</h1> 
<p>Everything found below is directly taken from the Canvas page of this assignment. I would describe this class as an in-depth analysis of the tools at your disposal. There were definitely times when I struggled with programming, but for the majority of this class, there was no difficulty with logic or conceptâ€”solely just learning about your tools and how to use them. For the outcomes of this class, I was taught the basics of operating systems and how to make use of your tools, but the biggest thing I learned was a soft skill: I was taught the value of getting started early and time management. This was a hard class and referred to as a weed-out class, but I was able to get through because I was diligent about my time management and completed all my projects a week before they were due.</p>
<h2>Description of files:</h2> 
<ul> 
  <strong>main.c:</strong> This is the code that creates the user interface.</br> 
  <strong>code.c:</strong> This code is where all the leg work is done.</br> <strong>smallsh:</strong> This is the executable file for the project.</br> 
  <strong>p3testscript:</strong> This is the test file my graders used.</br>
</ul> 

<h2>Criteria:</h2> In this assignment, you will write **smallsh**, your own shell in C. **smallsh** will implement a subset of features of well-known shells, such as bash. Your program will:
<ol> 
  <li>Provide a prompt for running commands.</li>
  <li>Handle blank lines and comments, which are lines beginning with the # character.</li>
  <li>Provide expansion for the variable $$.</li> <li>Execute 3 commands: exit, cd, and status via code built into the shell.</li>
  <li>Execute other commands by creating new processes using a function from the exec family of functions.</li>
  <li>Support input and output redirection.</li> <li>Support running commands in foreground and background processes.</li>
  <li>Implement custom handlers for 2 signals, SIGINT and SIGTSTP.</li>
</ol> 
<h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2> 
<ul> 
  <li>After successful completion of this assignment, you should be able to do the following:</li>
  <li>Describe the Unix process API (Module 4, MLO 2).</li> <li>Write programs using the Unix process API (Module 4, MLO 3).</li>
  <li>Explain the concept of signals and their uses (Module 5, MLO 2).</li> <li>Write programs using the Unix API for signal handling (Module 5, MLO 3).</li> 
  <li>Explain I/O redirection and write programs that can employ I/O redirection (Module 5, MLO 4).</li>
</ul>
